# Documentation for CSV Conversion Script

## Overview
This Python script is designed to read data from a text file and convert it into a CSV format. It generates a CSV file with predefined headers and additional information for each line of text read from the input file.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x must be installed on the machine.
- The input text file should exist at the specified path.

## Function Definitions
This function handles the conversion of the input text file to a CSV file.
- convert_to_csv(input_file_path, output_file_path)

### Parameters
- input_file_path (str): The path to the input text file to be converted.
- output_file_path (str): The path where the output CSV file will be saved.

## Behavior
Opens the input file for reading and the output file for writing.
Writes a header row to the CSV file.
Iterates through each line of the input file:
- Strips whitespace from the line.
- Writes a new row to the CSV file, including a row ID, the stripped line, and the current timestamp.
Handles file not found and other exceptions.

## Usage
To use the script, follow these steps:
- Ensure that the input text file groupe.txt exists in the Scripts directory
- Run the script :

```
python convert_to_csv.py
```

The output CSV file will be created at the specified *output_file_path*.

## Conclusion
This Python script provides an easy way to convert a text file into a CSV file with a predefined structure and additional information. Users can modify the input and output paths as needed. Error handling is included to manage common issues like missing files.
